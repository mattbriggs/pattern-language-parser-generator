# Pattern Language Miner: A Corpus-Driven Pattern Extraction and Generation Tool

## 🧩 Problem

Organizations often produce large volumes of documentation across training, help content, and reference material. This content often contains recurring structures, phrasing, and logic that are not explicitly recognized or reused. The absence of a systematic way to extract and reuse these patterns leads to:

* Duplicated effort in authoring
* Inconsistent style and logic
* Missed opportunities to apply AI-assisted reuse and retrieval

## 💡 Solution

The **Pattern Language Miner** provides an end-to-end solution to automatically extract, cluster, and catalog reusable content patterns using a combination of:

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Semantic similarity clustering
* Structured output in JSON Schema–validated YAML
* Optional semantic vector storage using Weaviate

It builds a machine- and human-readable library of patterns that can be reused, extended, and composed to improve documentation quality and maintainability.

## 🧪 Analyzing a Corpus

To analyze a corpus, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the content**:

   * Acceptable formats: `.txt`, `.md`, `.html`
   * Each file should represent a coherent unit (e.g., a section or topic)
   * Avoid embedded styles/scripts in HTML

2. **Run the miner**:

   ```bash
   python -m pattern_language_miner.cli analyze \\
     --input-dir ./docs \\
     --output-dir ./patterns \\
     --log-level INFO
   ```

3. **Review the output**:

   * YAML files are created per pattern
   * Each includes metadata (context, frequency, source)

## 🔁 Reusing and Generating New Patterns

The structured output enables reuse in both human and machine workflows. You can:

* Aggregate patterns by type (e.g., "Concept", "Procedure")
* Combine patterns into assemblies for documentation reuse
* Use AI tools to generate new variations of existing patterns

### Generative Grammar for New Patterns

Inspired by **Noam Chomsky's generative grammar**, you can:

* Define base syntactic structures from extracted patterns
* Use substitution and transformation rules to create new patterns
* Automatically synthesize documentation from semantic slots

Example pattern rule:

```
Pattern → Context + Problem + Solution + Example
```

New pattern:

```
If [condition], then [solution]. This addresses [problem]. For example, [example].
```

This approach builds a language of patterns, enabling automated content synthesis.

## 🏗 Software Design Patterns Used

The system architecture is modular and applies classic software engineering principles:

| Design Pattern      | Usage                                             |
| - | - |
| **Factory Method**  | Chooses parser based on file extension            |
| **Strategy**        | Swappable parser implementations (Text, Markdown) |
| **Command**         | CLI encapsulates analysis workflow                |
| **Adapter**         | Connects structured pattern output to Weaviate    |
| **Template Method** | BaseParser defines common parser interface        |
| **Builder**         | YAMLWriter assembles structured documents         |

These ensure the application is testable, extensible, and loosely coupled.

## 🔌 Extending the Application

The application was designed for flexibility and extension:

1. **New input formats**
   Add a parser that subclasses `BaseParser`.

2. **Alternative NLP models**
   Swap out NLTK with spaCy or transformers.

3. **Deeper semantic modeling**
   Extend `SemanticCluster` to use topic models or taxonomies.

4. **Web interface**
   Add a Streamlit or Flask UI for interactive review and editing.

5. **Authoring tools**
   Use the extracted patterns to generate pattern-based documentation templates.

## 📦 Summary

Pattern Language Miner helps identify and encode the reusable DNA of your documentation. It extracts, clusters, and structures repeating content patterns — and enables reusability at scale.

By grounding the tool in established linguistic theory and modern NLP, it not only automates detection of existing structure but also facilitates the generation of new, semantically consistent content.

It's a foundation for any organization that wants to evolve its documentation from static prose into a living system of modular knowledge.
